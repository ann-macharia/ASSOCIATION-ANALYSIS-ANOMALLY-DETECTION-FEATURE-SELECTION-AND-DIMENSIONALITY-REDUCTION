# ASSOCIATION-ANALYSIS-ANOMALLY-DETECTION-FEATURE-SELECTION-AND-DIMENSIONALITY-REDUCTION

While undertaking a project that will inform the marketing department of a local supermarket on the most relevant marketing strategies, I am tasked with a project divided into four parts.  I will explore a recent marketing dataset by performing various unsupervised learning techniques and later providing recommendations based on found insights.

Part 1: Dimensionality Reduction

This section of the project entails reducing dataset to a low dimensional dataset using the t-SNE algorithm or PCA.

Part 2: Feature Selection

This section entails performing feature selection through the use of the unsupervised learning methods.

Part 3: Association Rules

This section will requires creation of association rules that will allow to identify relationships between variables in the dataset. 

Part 4: Anomaly Detection

To check whether there are any anomalies in the given sales dataset. The objective of this task being fraud detection.
